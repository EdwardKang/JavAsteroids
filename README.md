Asteroids
=========

Controls
---------

up - accelerate
left/right - rotate ship counter-clockwise/clockwise

Description
------------

This is a simple asteroids game created through HTML, canvas and javascript.
In order for the controls to work properly I had to implement keymaster and another customized keymaster for 
jqueries keyup. 

TO DO
-------

1. Implement a Scores for the game, along with scoreboard (copy code from snake game)
2. Have different levels for once the board is cleared
3. Have set number of lives before game over.
